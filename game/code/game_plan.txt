 TODO

 - Debug code
   - Diagramming
   - Draw tile chunks so we can verify that things are aligned /
     in the chunks we want them to be in

 - Entity System 
   - What to do about geographically disparate entities that might only partially
     get streamed in to a sim region, but which need to move together as a unit?

 - Audio
   - Fix the clicking bug at the end of samples.

 - Rendering
   - What's up with the 18,000 rectangle draws?
   - Real projections with solid concept of project/unproject
   - Straighten out all of the coordinate systems.
     - Screen
     - World
     - Texture
   - Particle systems
   - Lighting
   - Final Optimisation
   - Hardware Rendering
     - Shaders
     - Render-to-texture

 ARCHITECTURE EXPLORATION
 - Z
   - Need to make a solid concept of ground levels so the camera can
     be freely placed in Z and have multiple ground levels in one sim
     region.
   - Concept of ground in the collision loop so it can handle
     collisions coming onto _and off of_ stairwells, for example.
   - Make sure flying things can go over low walls
   - Frinstances
     ZFUDGE
 - Collision detection
   - Clean up predicate proliferation. Can we make a nice clean
     set of flags/rules so that it's easy to understand how
     things work in terms of special handling? This may involve
     making the iteration handle everything instead of handling
     overlap outside and so on.
   - Transient collision rules, clear based on flag
     - Allow non-stransient rules to overide transient ones
   - Entry / exit?
   - What's the plan for robustness / shape definition?
   - Implement reprojection to handle interpenetration
   - Things pushing other things
 - Animtaion
   - Skeletal animation
   - Particle systems
 - Implement multiple sim regions per fram
   - Per-entity clocking
   - Sim region merging? For multiple players?
   - Simple zoomed-out view for testing
 - AI
   - Pathfinding
   - AI 'storage'

 PRODUCTION
 -> GAME
   - Rudimentary world gen (no quality, just 'what sorts of things' we do)
     - Placement of background things
     - Connectivity?
     - Non-overlapping?
     - Map display
       - Magnets - how do they work?
 - Metagame / save game
   - How do you enter a 'save slot'?
   - Persistent unlocks/etc
   - Do we allow saved games? Probably yes, just for 'pausing',
   * Continuous save for crash recovery?
